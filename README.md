# Firelink

This is code for a prototype of early Wildfire detection system. This part of the project demonstrates how the drone can take off from the base, fly around, land in the base and close the base. 

The final version is supposed to have multiple bases of similar oxes set up in national parks and the drones and th ebases are supposed to communicate with each other, thus gettign information from the whole forrest. Based on the information gathered, the drones are supposed to change their flight patterns and frequency. 

This is a demonstration of the self-flying and landing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB71ZzNvr-M
